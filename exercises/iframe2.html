            <ul>Ingredients
                <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
                <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>
                <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>
                <li>½ cup olive oil for frying, or as needed</li>
                <li>½ cup prepared tomato sauce</li>
                <li>¼ cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes</li>
                <li>¼ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
                <li>½ cup grated provolone cheese</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>Directions
                <li>Pound the boneless chicken breasts out to an even width so they cook evenly. Basically,
                     you're pounding the thick part down to the size of the thin part, about a half-inch thick. 
                </li>
                <li>Salt and pepper the chicken well. Then don't bother with salting the flour and bread crumbs. </li>
                <li>
                    Use Panko bread crumbs mixed with a little finely grated Parmesan cheese. When you fry the breaded chicken,
                     the Parmesan will give it an extra crunch and exciting flavor. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Before frying, let the breaded chicken sit on the counter for about 15 minutes to allow the coating to adhere 
                    to the chicken breast. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    THE KEY: Don't drown the poor breaded and fried chicken in sauce and smother it in cheese. Too much of a good 
                    thing is too much. You did all the work creating a crisp coating, why make it soggy with too much sauce 
                    and cheese? 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Be sure your oven is completely preheated to 450 F. You'll want the cheese to brown slightly and the breading 
                    to crisp up before the chicken gets overcooked, and a nice hot oven is the way to go. 
                </li>
