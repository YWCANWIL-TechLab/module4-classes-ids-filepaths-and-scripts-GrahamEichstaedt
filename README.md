# Module4-Classes-IDs-Scripts-and-Filepaths

The more we learn about Web Development, the more complicated our code will get. If we don't use some of our new tools,
our jobs as developers will get very difficult. We can use a combination of Classes, IDs, Iframes, and JavaScript to 
manage the complexity of our code.

Although we're getting some exposure to JavaScript already, do not feel you need to fully understand JavaScript yet. 
We'll cover JavaScript in detail in the final section of this class. We'll show off what it can do, but otherwise 
its only being covered to help you with some out of place questions on the certification exam.
